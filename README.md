# Weather-app
Link to my weather app is found [here](https://krisderycke.github.io/Weather-app/index.html).

## What:
I have to make a weather app using API keys.


## How:
I first start with reading documentation about using API keys.
Then i will look into making a (responsive) design using HTML&CSS. also using Figma(no idea yet what that is).

## Bonus Specs:
* Use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for layout
* Use [Gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap) for your animations

### Conclussion:
At first struggled with getting the API to work but once i got it, it was nice to extract the data from it.
Also used an API to change the background picture to a corresponding city picture.
It was a very good excercise to s-learn "for-loops". Although i am still not too confident in using them, i was able to clean up my code with about 60lines using the loops.
